The classes and interfaces within the world package describe the game world state and behavior.


Class Overview:

GameWorld: Creates, stores, updates, and removes game objects, which are referred to as Entities.

Entity: Base class for all objects that live in the game world.

StaticEntity: Immovable game object that lacks intelligence.

Terrain: A static entity that represents a terrain type.

ActorEntity: Game object that may be movable, and that may update itself in its update method or through the use of attached controllers.


Interface Overview:

Collidable: Indicates that the entity participates in collision detection. A collidable object may be solid, in which case it blocks
other collidable objects, or not solid.

TerrainImprovement: An entity that sits on top of a terrain. Each terrain can only have at most one attached terrain improvement.

Damageable: An entity that can receive damage.

WaterType: Marker interface indicating that this is a water type.
